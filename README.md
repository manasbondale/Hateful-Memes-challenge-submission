**Hateful Memes Challenge Submission: Multi-Modal Offensiveness Detection**

![Hateful Memes]

Welcome to our submission for the Hateful Memes Challenge hosted by Meta! In this challenge, we tackled the task of detecting the offensiveness of memes, specifically focusing on multi-modal input consisting of 
images overlaid with captions. Our submission is a neural network transformer model capable of analyzing these multi-modal inputs and providing accurate predictions regarding the offensiveness of the content.

**Model Overview:**
- Our model is built upon the Transformer architecture, a powerful deep learning model known for its effectiveness in handling sequential and multi-modal data.
- It takes as input an image with an overlaid caption and processes both the visual and textual information simultaneously.
- The model leverages pre-trained embeddings and attention mechanisms to capture intricate relationships between the image content and associated captions.
- Through extensive training and fine-tuning, our model has achieved a high level of accuracy in identifying offensive content within memes.

**Accuracy Achieved:**
- Our submission has achieved an impressive accuracy of 76% on the provided test dataset.
- This accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in accurately detecting offensive content in memes, even in the presence of diverse visual and textual contexts.

**How to Use:**
1. **Input Data:** Provide the model with an image overlaid with a caption.
2. **Prediction:** Run the input through the model to receive a multi-modal output indicating the predicted offensiveness of the content.
3. **Interpretation:** Interpret the output to understand the model's assessment of the offensiveness level.

**Note:** Ensure that the input data adheres to the format expected by the model for optimal performance.
